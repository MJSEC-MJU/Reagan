However, there is more to Los Angeles than meets the eye. After you’ve had your fill of learning about Hollywood history and seeing luxurious VIP’s mansions, take your time to explore the rest of the second largest and most diverse city in the US. The city of angels is an endless reservoir of natural beauty, sports events and about any artistic expression you can think of.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t But to actually reach and enjoy all that Los Angeles has to offer, you need strict planning. In fact, L.A. is very spread out and doesn’t have one city center that organically connects all must-see attractions in the city. Unlike other major north American cities like San Francisco and New York, without proper planning you could feel that you’ve wasted most of your vacation commuting. We’re here to help! Keep this travel guide to hand to make sure you don’t miss out on anything.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p><small>TABLE OF CONTENTS</small></p>\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t<ul style=\"background-color: #efefef; margin-top: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px\">\n\t\t\t\t <li><a href=\"#Facts\">Facts and figures about Los Angeles</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t <li><a href=\"#WhereToSleep\">Where to sleep in Los Angeles</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t <li><a href=\"#Attractions\">Top attractions &amp; cultural highlights in Los Angeles</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t <li><a href=\"#StreetFood\">Most iconic street food in Los Angeles</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t <li><a href=\"#Restaurants\">Best and trendy restaurants in Los Angeles</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t <li><a href=\"#Nightlife\">Nightlife in Los Angeles</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t <li><a href=\"#Sports\">Sports in Los Angeles</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"col-12 my-3\">\n\t\t\t\t<div style=\"background-color: #dedede; padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 10px\">\n\t\t\t\tAlso check out this other report: <a href=\"https://www.losangeles.com\">Los Angeles – A Local's Guide to L.A.</a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div> \n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"row mt-2\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"col-12\">\n\t\t\t\t<h2 id=\"Facts\">Facts and figures about Los Angeles</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"img/photo2.jpg\" alt=\"Los Angeles Citizens\" class=\"img-fluid\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"PhotoCredit\">Photo by Omar Lopez on Unsplash.

Many tourists from all over the world find L.A. familiar and bewildering at the same time. But why is that? Well, did you know that Los Angeles is one the most diverse places in the world? L.A. residents come from over 140 countries and speak a whopping 224 different languages. According to a census from 2010, the population of L.A. is: \n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>49.8% White</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>9.6% African American</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>0.7% Native American</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>11.3% Asian</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>0.1% Pacific Islander</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>23.8% other races </li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>4.6% from two or more races</li>\n\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t Unsurprisingly, <strong>Hispanic people or Latinos of any race make up to 48.5% of Los Angeles population.</strong>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t Los Angeles inspires its many visitors to immerse themselves in its diverse culture, explore the never-ending natural amenities it offers and generally to enjoy the open-hearted welcome of all its communities. What else do you want to know about the city? Here’s a breakdown of the most important figures of the city of angels.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<h3>Geography, climate &amp; population</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"img/photo3.jpg\" alt=\"Hollywood Sunset\" class=\"img-fluid\">\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"PhotoCredit\">Photo by Izayah Ramos on Unsplash. Free to use</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t Los Angeles City is both <strong>flat and hilly</strong>, but for higher mountains you need to actually leave the urban center. In the north, you’ll find the <strong>San Gabriel Mountains</strong>, where the highest peak, Mount San Antonio (aka. Mount Baldy), reaches 10 064 feet (3 068 m).\n\t\t\t\t Thanks to the city’s <strong>diversity of habitats</strong>, including lush beaches and mountains, Los Angeles has a rich variety of native plants. Unfortunately, some of these plants have become so rare that they’re considered endangered. Lastly, it’s worth mentioning that Los Angeles is sometimes subject to earthquakes, but most low-intensity earthquakes can barely be felt.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<h4>Size &amp; Cityscape</h4>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t Los Angeles is the <strong>largest city in the state of California</strong>. It extends for around 470 sq miles, that’s around 1200 sq km. The city is composed by many districts, some of which used to be towns and cities in their own right, and that have merged with Los Angeles as it grew over time. This gives to Los Angeles its decentralized character, where each neighborhood has as many touristic attractions and opportunities as the other.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<h4>Climate &amp; Geology</h4>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t Los Angeles is known for its <strong>Mediterranean climate</strong>, with dry summers and very mild winters. In winter, temperatures average around 68 °F (20 °C), giving the city a <strong>tropical vibe</strong> without reaching the scorching temperatures of a true tropical climate. Summer usually goes by with no rain at all, but the seasonal change in late summer brings brief thunderstorms. \n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t The many fault systems running throughout Los Angeles lead to several earthquakes per year. Los Angeles is in fact located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, giving the area a certain geological instability. Although many people in LA County feel the ground shaking a couple times a year, most of these earthquakes are mild or moderate and cause little damage.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t Due to its climate and geology, Los Angeles is particularly vulnerable to the consequences of climate change.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<h4>Population &amp; Standards of Living</h4>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t As the second most populous city in the United States (ranking after New York City) Los Angeles is home to roughly <strong>3.9 million people</strong> as of 2020, but against popular belief, not everyone in Los Angeles is rich. \n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t It’s true that the top 5% of earners in LA cane make more than $500,000, and that to be financially comfortable in the city you’d need a net worth of roughly $1.3 million, however the annual salary in Los Angeles averages at $67,057.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t This means, that a good part of the almost 4 million people living in Los Angeles doesn’t earn enough to live comfortably in the city. The minimum wage in the state of California is $14-15 an hour depending on the size of the company.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<h3>Los Angeles districts and suburbs</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tUntil the 1920s, Los Angeles had a fairly ‘traditional’ urban pattern, with one centralized commercial area. However, with the economic expansion that turned Los Angeles into a manufacturing center, came also a rapidly increasing number of residents. Especially with the immigration wave of the 50s, many manufacturing firms were built in the suburbs where cheaper accommodation was more readily available for the workers. The traditional, centralized and walkable city gave way to a decentralized network of communities, tightly connected with the freeway also built in the 50s. From chic Hollywood to the hippest food trucks, Los Angeles diverse population has given rise to unique districts that have their own vibe, lifestyle and culture. \n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<h4>Hollywood</h4>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t Have you even seen Los Angeles if you didn’t walk through Hollywood? The stars and starlets of the American showbiz have famously made Los Angeles their home of choice – and this district is where you’ll find them. As soon as you can, head towards the <strong>Hollywood Sign</strong>. A picture with this cultural icon is a must.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<h4>Venice</h4>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t Located in the Westside of Los Angeles, this district is called Venice due to its canals, beach and <strong>Ocean Front Walk</strong>. Palm trees, skaters, street musicians, delicious street food and street art: Venice is where all the locals flock to. Enjoy the relaxed atmosphere and feel like a true Angeleno on the beach.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<h4>Downtown L.A. or the Art District</h4>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t This district is as cool as its name sounds. This is urban area is known for its colourful street art all the art galleries that make up the art scene in Los Angeles. This is considered one of the best areas to stay in while in L.A., as it is packed with attractions such as the <strong>Grand Central Market</strong> and the <strong>Staples Center</strong>, as well as some of very best bars and restaurants in the city.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<h4>Chinatown</h4>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t This district is only a stone's throw away from downtown and is widely appreciated for its huge offering of <strong>Asian delicacies</strong>. Immerse yourself in the vibrant culture of the district walking along Hill Street and Broadway, north of Cesar Chavez Avenue. If you happen to be here in the summer, swing by <strong>Chinatown Plaza</strong> and you’ll have your pick of festivals and events.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<h4>San Fernando Valley, or the Valley</h4>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t In the Valley is where you’ll find many of the most iconic <strong>film studios</strong> such as Warner Bros and Walt Disney. In addition, it is home to the Universal Studios Hollywood theme park. In actuality, only 80% of the Valley belongs to the urban area of Los Angeles, and only recently many numerous development projects are also including this district.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<h4>Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Bel Air and Pasadena</h4>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t Contrary to popular belief, none of these towns are districts of Los Angeles. These are independent communities that belong to Los Angeles County beyond the city limits. Nonetheless, these suburban areas are all worth visiting if you wish to feel like a local.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"img/photo4.jpg\" alt=\"Building by the beach in Santa Monica Pier\" class=\"img-fluid\">\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"PhotoCredit\">Photo by Seth Maughan on Unsplash.

There are many things to do in L.A. in many different districts. Fortunately, you’ll find all kinds of accommodations located in all districts of L.A. and at drastically different prizing points. \n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t Los Angeles offers, in fact, hundreds of hotels with more thousands of rooms to choose from. The city’s hotel offer grows bigger each year following the increasing demand of the tourism industry. That’s why our best recommendation, when choosing where to sleep in L.A., is not to choose the best hotel, but to rather look at the best district. \n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t What’s the point of sleeping comfortably if you spend all your time commuting during your stay?

Such a culturally diverse city was always bound to become a creative powerhouse of the US and, of course, you wish to see it all. However, the sprawling city of Los Angeles makes reaching all its key destinations a challenge in itself, not to mention the scorching temperature that might render waiting times almost unbearable during the warmest months. Luckily, recent upgrades to the public transport system have made getting around a lot easier. To help you plan a reasonable sightseeing itinerary, we’ve prepared a list of top attractions and cultural highlights in Los Angeles.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"img/photo7.jpg\" alt=\"Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles, CA, USA\" class=\"img-fluid\">\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"PhotoCredit\">Photo by Venti Views on Unsplash.

Sunseekers will find plenty of things to do, in fact if you plan your trip in advance, make sure to book some surf lessons or yoga classes to get the most out of your L.A. experience.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t→ <strong>Highlights of Venice Beach:</strong> the Boardwalk, the Muscle Beach, and the Venice Skate Park.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<h4>Walk of Fame</h4>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<figure class=\"float-start mb-3 me-3\">\n\t\t\t\t  <picture>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"img/photo8.jpg\" alt=\"Dolby Theater in Hollywood Boulevard\" class=\"img-fluid\">\n\t\t\t\t  </picture>\n\t\t\t\t  <figcaption class=\"PhotoCredit\">Photo by Benoit Debaix on Unsplash.

Probably one of few free attractions of Los Angeles, the Walk of Fame is runs fifteen blocks along Hollywood Boulevard, along which you can find many restaurants, classic movie theaters, museums and – of course – celebrity impersonators! If you time your trip with the Academy Awards, this is where you’ll find the Dolby Theater - where the famous ceremony is held.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t <strong>Highlights of the Walk of Fame:</strong> celebrity stars and impersonators, the Hollywood Highland Center, and the Dolby Theater tour.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<h4>Beverly Hills</h4>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t Just about anything you associate with luxury, fame and wealth can be found in Beverly Hills. In fact, it’s well-known that Hollywood stars have made Mulholland Drive in Beverly Hills their home and some stars’ villas are even open for tourists to visit. If you enjoy celebrity gossip and shopping, you’re in for a treat. \n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t→ <strong>Highlights of Beverly Hills:</strong> Rodeo Drive, Greystone Mansion and Gardens, Will Rogers Memorial Park, and the Trolley Tours.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<h4>Hollywood Sign</h4>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t There is nothing more iconic and so quintessentially L.A. than this sign towering over the hills. To get a good shot of the sign we recommend travelling along Mulholland Highway or trying your luck on a clear day in the Griffith Observatory and Lake Hollywood Park. And although some tourists will choose to spare themselves the hike up the hill to get a close-up of the Hollywood sign, getting a picture of it when they visit the Highland Center instead, we highly recommend the trip. A tour to walk up to the Hollywood Sign takes about 2 to 3 hours, but it is definitely worth your time.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t→ <strong>Walk-up the Hollywood Sign:</strong> 4 miles total, 2-3 hours, little to no shade. Bring sunscreen, hat or other head coverage, and lots of water.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<h4>Universal Studios Hollywood</h4>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t Did you know that the Universal Studios is the only working movie studio and theme park in the world? We can’t recommend it enough, because there’s really something for everyone at the Universal Studios. Take an insightful tour, try the most thrilling rides and, of course, enjoy family-friendly attractions where the little ones are as welcome as you are. \n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t→ <strong>Highlights of Universal Studios:</strong> The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Jurassic World – The Ride, Springfield (The Simpson’s ride), and the Studio Tour. \n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"img/photo9.jpg\" alt=\"Universal Studios Plaza, Orlando, FL, USA\" class=\"img-fluid\">\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"PhotoCredit\">Photo by Aditya Vyas on Unsplash.

It doesn’t matter how often you’ve been to the Disneyland Resort, there will always be something new to see. This enormous multi-park resort complex is a place to marvel at. Just avoid visiting the park without a plan and make sure to make the most of your trip by buying tickets online first. \n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t→ <strong>Recommendations for Disneyland Park:</strong> plan a 2-day visit and book a hotel nearby, get to the park before it opens and get a locker. Check the Disneyland app for wait times at attractions.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<h4>Santa Monica Pier &amp; Beach</h4>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"img/photo10.jpg\" alt=\"Santa Monica Pier\" class=\"float-start me-3 mb-3 img-fluid\">\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"PhotoCredit\">Photo by Matthew LeJune on Unsplash.

However, you should be sure to get your camera ready to snap the most stunning views of the ocean and the Santa Monica Mountains while you’re there too. For the foody tourists: don’t miss out on the Santa Monica farmers’ market.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t→ <strong>Highlights of Santa Monica Pier:</strong> the Looff Hippodrome, the Santa Monica Yacht Harbor neon sign, and the Original Muscle Beach. \n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"row mt-2\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"col-12\">\n\t\t\t\t<h2 id=\"StreetFood\">Most iconic street food in Los Angeles</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<figure class=\"float-start mb-3 me-3\">\n\t\t\t\t  <picture>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"img/photo11.jpg\" alt=\"Mexican Food\" class=\"img-fluid\">\n\t\t\t\t  </picture>\n\t\t\t\t  <figcaption class=\"PhotoCredit\">Photo by Jarritos Mexican Soda on Unsplash.

Los Angeles has some of the best street food on offer in the US. In fact, as people from all over the world have settled here and brought the most amazing food from their respective countries with them, the street food scene in L.A. deserves a whole tour for itself.

You can set your own pace for enjoying all the elements of this luxurious and dynamic dining experience.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><strong>LA Cha Cha Chá:</strong> you’re looking for the most Mexican experience in Los Angeles?

Beverly Hills is home to many but this one if certainly a cut above the rest. Their international take on the American classic allows every diner to choose more than just how the steak is cooked, but also where the meat comes from. </li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><strong>Gucci Osteria:</strong> at the intersection of fine dining and fashion, as one would expect from its name, we find Gucci Osteria. The world-renowned chef Massimo Bottura also runs an osteria in Florence (first of its name) and is sure to bring only the best of Tuscany’s cuisine to your table with, of course, the inevitable and enjoyable Californian twist. </li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><strong>Pasjoli:</strong> for French cuisine lovers, Pasjoli is a bistro that will elevate even the most understated onion soup.

The Dodger Stadium, home to the L.A. Dodgers, is one of the most well-known baseball pitches in the US as well as the filming location of some old-time favorites like <i>The Fast and The Furious, City of Angels and Superman Returns.</i>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"img/photo14.jpg\" alt=\"Baseball Stadium\" class=\"img-fluid\">\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"PhotoCredit\">Photo by Hank Paul on Unsplash.

The former home of the Rams is also in L.A. - the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which is the oldest football stadium in the National Football League and definitely worth a visit.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<figure class=\"float-start mb-3 me-3\">\n\t\t\t\t  <picture>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"img/photo15.jpg\" alt=\"Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum\" class=\"img-fluid\">\n\t\t\t\t  </picture>\n\t\t\t\t  <figcaption class=\"PhotoCredit\">Photo by Sean Pierce on Unsplash.
