Invisible Things Lab has\npresented numerous attacks against virtualization systems and Intel\nsecurity technologies, including a famous series of exploits against\nIntel Trusted Execution Technology.</p>\n\n<p>Our attack against Intel VT-d, allowing for a full VM escape, is still\nthe only one that has been demonstrated. We’re also known for showing\nthat it’s possible to break into Intel vPro BIOS and Active Management\nTechnology. This expertise in how to “break” secure systems gives us a\nunique advantage in building them: We know how to think like attackers,\nand we understand how to design systems to be truly secure from the\nground up.</p>\n\n<p>Our team is among the best in the world at identifying exploits in\nbinaries and developing mitigations against them. We can help you\nanalyze the impact of security vulnerabilities, create proof-of-concept\nexploits, decide on appropriate mitigation measures, and advise on\nimplementing and configuring them.</p>\n\n<p>With our deep knowledge of kernel security, we advise on kernel\ncompromises, advanced rootkits, integrity checking, and kernel\nexploitation techniques. Not only can we help you design and implement\nkernel and system code; we can also perform a comprehensive security\nreview of an existing or planned implementation.</p>\n\n<p>With decades of experience on the cutting edge of virtualization\nsecurity, we’re well-equipped to advise on hypervisor attacks, secure\nhypervisor design, and secure hypervisor implementation. In addition, we\noffer security reviews on all of these aspects of virtualization.</p>\n\n<p>Last but not least, our extensive hardware and firmware security\nexperience makes us among the best choices in the world for BIOS, SMM,\nand chipset security, including the identification of vulnerabilities,\nthe development of proof-of-concept exploits, and comprehensive code\nreview. This includes decades of experience in advanced security\ntechnologies like x86 virtualization (e.g., VT-x, VT-d, and AMD-V),\nIntel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT), and Trusted Platform Modules\n(TPMs).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"qubes-os-consulting\">Qubes OS consulting</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.qubes-os.org/\">Qubes OS</a> takes a uniquely effective\napproach to security. While the cybersecurity threats to companies and\nindividuals have sharply increased in both number and sophistication,\nconventional operating systems are generally still monolithic in nature,\nleaving them vulnerable to total system compromise in the event of a\nzero-day exploit.</p>\n\n<p>By contrast, Qubes has pioneered an approach called Security by\nCompartmentalization, which allows users to compartmentalize different\ndigital activities into securely isolated compartments called “qubes” so\nthat if one qube is compromised, the others remain unaffected. Moreover,\nQubes seamlessly integrates all of these secure containers into a\nunified desktop environment, providing a decisive advantage in user\nexperience and productivity over traditional methods of isolation.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"gramine-consulting\">Gramine consulting</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gramineproject.io/\">Gramine</a> is a library OS designed to run\nLinux applications in restricted environments like Intel SGX enclaves.\nThis approach minimizes the porting effort required when migrating to\n<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/what-is-confidential-computing\">confidential\ncomputing</a>\nwhile maintaining a minimal attack surface. Invisible Things Lab is the\ndriving force behind the core development of Gramine and employs the\nleading experts on this cutting-edge technology.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"leadership\">Leadership</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"michał-chiliński\">Michał Chiliński</h3>\n\n<h4 id=\"chief-executive-officer\">Chief Executive Officer</h4>\n\n<p>Michał is an experienced technology project manager.
